Data on the number of LAC in England in March 2012 taken from the DfE 901 return were then used to calculate the unit cost per LAC (see SFR20, Table LAA1: Children looked after at 31 March, by Local Authority).  The Section 251 data encompasses the following areas of LAC expenditure: residential care; fostering services; other children looked after services; secure accommodation (welfare); short breaks (respite) for looked after disabled children; children placed with family and friends; advocacy services for LAC; education of LAC; leaving care support services; and asylum seeker services children.  We have also included half of the total cost quoted in the Section 251 return for 'Children and Young People Safety', based upon evidence that suggests that around a third of total children's social care caseload is LAC, but that LAC tend to account for a higher proportion of expenditure.  The method was chosen over other types of calculation and sources of potential headline data, as it considers expenditure across a range of different care settings for LAC, and provides an average across all the localities in England.  In practice, as demonstrated by some of the subsidiary costs below (many of which are based on particular scenarios that outline LAC with varying degrees of need), expenditure on LAC varies widely depending on the needs of the child and the local context (for example, areas with high numbers of LAC but fewer available foster care places may have a higher proportion of LAC provision in residential homes, which are considerably more expensive than foster homes).  The same approach can be used to derive data for individual localities/areas - for example, under this methodology the Greater Manchester mean cost for LAC is £40,151 (2011/12 prices).  However, note that local authority approaches to completing the Section 251 return vary, and the data for some areas are open to question - hence the amber flag allocated to this cost line.  To ensure full confidence in the robustness of data, it is recommended that local areas calculate their own unit costs from total expenditure on LAC divided by the number of LAC this expenditure relates to.",http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/strategy/financeandfunding/section251/b00202559/s251-workbooks-outturn-2010-11

This measure represents the fiscal savings to public sector agencies derived from the delivery of parenting programmes for parents of five-year old children with conduct disorder - it is the average savings per child over a 25 year period, to age 30; the research assumes that, for parents completing programmes, 33% of children improve to ‘no problems' and 5% to 'moderate conduct problems', but behaviour changes are not sustained beyond one year for 50% of children who initially improve.  The source gives a breakdown of potential savings over the 25 year period, providing the following costs at different stages: age 6 (savings over the first year following delivery of the parenting programme), £324; age 7-16 (savings for years 2-11 after programme delivery), £2,493 (averaging out at £249 per year over the ten year period); age 17-30 (savings for years 12-25 after programme delivery), £551 (£39 per year over the 14 year period).  Constituent costs for the individual agencies are given in the cost lines below.  As shown in the related headline and subsidiary measures above, the median cost of an 8-12 week group-based parenting programme is £952 per family, and £2,078 for an individually-based programme, with the average for both estimated at £1,177 per family - put alongside these potential savings, it is evident that such programmes can offer good value for money, although the break-even point is estimated at an average eight years post-intervention.  Note that the research did not model further fiscal benefits from reduced adult mental health issues and improved outcomes for the child’s family and peers, which would increase the cost-effectiveness of parenting interventions aimed at addressing conduct disorder.  In addition to the fiscal benefits, the source quotes (economic) benefits over 25 years to non-public sector bodies/individuals as follows: victim costs (crime), £4,171; lost output (crime), £1,227; other crime costs, £506; voluntary sector, £15 (see p.7 of the source report for details of how these costs are distributed over the 25 years period).",https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/147343/dh_126386.pdf.pdf
