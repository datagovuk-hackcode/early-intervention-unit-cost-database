This measure represents the fiscal savings to public sector agencies derived from the delivery of SEL programmes - it is the average saving per child over a ten year period.  The research assumes that children receive the intervention aged ten years old, and start in one of three different conduct ‘health states’: no conduct problems, mild conduct problems or severe conduct problems.  The source gives a breakdown of potential savings over the ten year period, providing the following costs at different stages: year 1 (savings over the first year following delivery of the SEL programme), £83; year 5 (savings for years 1-5 after programme delivery), £2,038; year 10 (savings for years 1-10 after programme delivery), £3,206 (all at 2009-10 prices).  The average annual saving over the ten year period is £321.  Constituent costs for the individual agencies are given in the cost lines below.  As detailed in the source (see the Education and Skills section of this database), the costs of a representative intervention, including teacher training, programme coordinator and materials were estimated as £132 per child - put alongside these potential savings, it is evident that such programmes can offer good value for money, with the overall break-even point after the first year following the intervention, and the education sector breaking even after five years.  Note that the research did not model wider outcomes such as improved academic performance, or benefits accruing to parents, siblings or other peers.
