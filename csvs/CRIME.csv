",Multiple,,Per incident,2470,2008/09," £2,766 ","Sylvia Walby - The Cost of Domestic violence, update (2009), p.8",A,"This cost is based upon the Walby (2009) publication referenced in the source column, which gives data on the total cost of domestic violence (DV) in England and Wales to public services, along with the economic and human/emotional (social) costs.  An average cost per incident has been derived using data from the British Crime Survey (BCS) on the incidence of DV in England and Wales, which has been factored up to account for a substantial undercount in the main BCS (people are reluctant to answer sensitive questions face-to-face with an interviewer); a multiplier of x5 has been used, based on research in a related Walby report that found that the prevalence of DV identified in the more accurate BCS self-completion module was approximately five times greater than that reported in the face-to-face survey (see Walby, 2004: 'HO Research Study 276 - Domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking - findings from the BCS', p.112).  The constituent costs reported in the rows below are derived from evidence on the profile of DV costs across public agencies given in an earlier (2004) Walby report, 'The Cost of Domestic Violence'; this profile was then applied to the updated total cost in the 2009 Walby publication.  Note that the Walby costs are per incident over the lifetime of the victim - we have assumed that the identified fiscal costs are, in the main, likely to be expended relatively soon after the incident, and can therefore be considered as an annual fiscal cost per incident.  Walby's 2009 update paper also gives total economic and social costs associated with domestic violence: following the same approach used to derive the fiscal costs, the average economic cost per incident is £1,473 (08-09 prices); this comprises costs to the individual of £818, and to employers of £655, related to time off work due to injuries (and also, for individuals, travel/lost wages for GP visits, prescription charges, the cost of setting up new homes/re-possession following divorce and separation due to DV, and civil/legal costs).  The average social cost per incident is £6,795 (also 08-09 prices), based on the human and emotional cost associated with DV (Walby derives this from estimates of what people would pay to avoid injuries/trauma relating to DV).  As for the fiscal costs, we can assume that the economic costs are relatively short-term, so can be considered as an annual economic cost per incident; however, the social costs may be longer-term, particularly in terms of mental health issues, which could endure over the victim's lifetime.  An amber flag has been applied to the costs, given the assumptions involved and the lower level of confidence that can be attached to the data used to derive the per incident values.",http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/doc_library/sociology/Cost_of_domestic_violence_update.doc
