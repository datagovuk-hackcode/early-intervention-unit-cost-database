This measure represents the fiscal savings to public sector agencies derived from the delivery of parenting programmes for parents of five-year old children with conduct disorder - it is the average savings per child over a 25 year period, to age 30; the research assumes that, for parents completing programmes, 33% of children improve to ‘no problems' and 5% to 'moderate conduct problems', but behaviour changes are not sustained beyond one year for 50% of children who initially improve.
