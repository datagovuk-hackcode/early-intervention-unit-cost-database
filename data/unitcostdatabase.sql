Data on the number of LAC in England in March 2012 taken from the DfE 901 return were then used to calculate the unit cost per LAC (see SFR20, Table LAA1: Children looked after at 31 March, by Local Authority).  The Section 251 data encompasses the following areas of LAC expenditure: residential care; fostering services; other children looked after services; secure accommodation (welfare); short breaks (respite) for looked after disabled children; children placed with family and friends; advocacy services for LAC; education of LAC; leaving care support services; and asylum seeker services children.  We have also included half of the total cost quoted in the Section 251 return for ''Children and Young People Safety'', based upon evidence that suggests that around a third of total children''s social care caseload is LAC, but that LAC tend to account for a higher proportion of expenditure.  The method was chosen over other types of calculation and sources of potential headline data, as it considers expenditure across a range of different care settings for LAC, and provides an average across all the localities in England.  In practice, as demonstrated by some of the subsidiary costs below (many of which are based on particular scenarios that outline LAC with varying degrees of need), expenditure on LAC varies widely depending on the needs of the child and the local context (for example, areas with high numbers of LAC but fewer available foster care places may have a higher proportion of LAC provision in residential homes, which are considerably more expensive than foster homes).  The same approach can be used to derive data for individual localities/areas - for example, under this methodology the Greater Manchester mean cost for LAC is Â£40,151 (2011/12 prices).  However, note that local authority approaches to completing the Section 251 return vary, and the data for some areas are open to question - hence the amber flag allocated to this cost line.  To ensure full confidence in the robustness of data, it is recommended that local areas calculate their own unit costs from total expenditure on LAC divided by the number of LAC this expenditure relates to.', 7, 30, 8, 50, 70, NULL),

This measure represents the fiscal savings to public sector agencies derived from the delivery of parenting programmes for parents of five-year old children with conduct disorder - it is the average savings per child over a 25 year period, to age 30; the research assumes that, for parents completing programmes, 33% of children improve to âno problems'' and 5% to ''moderate conduct problems'', but behaviour changes are not sustained beyond one year for 50% of children who initially improve.

This measure represents the fiscal savings to public sector agencies derived from the delivery of SEL programmes - it is the average saving per child over a ten year period.  The research assumes that children receive the intervention aged ten years old, and start in one of three different conduct âhealth statesâ: no conduct problems, mild conduct problems or severe conduct problems.  The source gives a breakdown of potential savings over the ten year period, providing the following costs at different stages: year 1 (savings over the first year following delivery of the SEL programme), Â£83; year 5 (savings for years 1-5 after programme delivery), Â£2,038; year 10 (savings for years 1-10 after programme delivery), Â£3,206 (all at 2009-10 prices).

As detailed in the source (see the Education and Skills section of this database), the costs of a representative intervention, including teacher training, programme coordinator and materials were estimated as Â£132 per child - put alongside these potential savings, it is evident that such programmes can offer good value for money, with the overall break-even point after the first year following the intervention, and the education sector breaking even after five years.

An average cost per incident has been derived using data from the British Crime Survey (BCS) on the incidence of DV in England and Wales, which has been factored up to account for a substantial undercount in the main BCS (people are reluctant to answer sensitive questions face-to-face with an interviewer); a multiplier of x5 has been used, based on research in a related Walby report that found that the prevalence of DV identified in the more accurate BCS self-completion module was approximately five times greater than that reported in the face-to-face survey (see Walby, 2004: ''HO Research Study 276 - Domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking - findings from the BCS'', p.112).  The constituent costs reported in the rows below are derived from evidence on the profile of DV costs across public agencies given in an earlier (2004) Walby report, ''The Cost of Domestic Violence''; this profile was then applied to the updated total cost in the 2009 Walby publication.  Note that the Walby costs are per incident over the lifetime of the victim - we have assumed that the identified fiscal costs are, in the main, likely to be expended relatively soon after the incident, and can therefore be considered as an annual fiscal cost per incident.  Walby''s 2009 update paper also gives total economic and social costs associated with domestic violence: following the same approach used to derive the fiscal costs, the average economic cost per incident is Â£1,473 (08-09 prices); this comprises costs to the individual of Â£818, and to employers of Â£655, related to time off work due to injuries (and also, for individuals, travel/lost wages for GP visits, prescription charges, the cost of setting up new homes/re-possession following divorce and separation due to DV, and civil/legal costs).  The average social cost per incident is Â£6,795 (also 08-09 prices), based on the human and emotional cost associated with DV (Walby derives this from estimates of what people would pay to avoid injuries/trauma relating to DV).  As for the fiscal costs, we can assume that the economic costs are relatively short-term, so can be considered as an annual economic cost per incident; however, the social costs may be longer-term, particularly in terms of mental health issues, which could endure over the victim''s lifetime.
